<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p class="subtitle">looking back and next steps</p>
<h2>Talk About It</h2>
<p>All of the work that we have described is extra labor.
You will not want to do it,
particularly not when so many other things demand attention as well.
Make that work meaningful by helping others.
Tell your colleagues what you have learned about your institution's legal requirements,
about navigating its bureaucracy,
and about the least hurtful way to break the news to your students, collaborators, and users.
Share your own tips on social media
(preferably Mastodon rather than X or Bluesky,
as the latter two are single points of institutional failure),
and share things that \emph{haven't} worked as well
so that other people can avoid the same pitfalls.</p>
<p>Sharing your experience during a difficult time is valuable even if your only audience is yourself.
Writing down what happened, what you did, how you felt, what you have learned, and what you hope for
are evidence-based strategies for protecting your mental health in stressful times
and for healing afterwards \cite{Pennebaker2016,Cullen2022}.</p>
<p>Most importantly,
take the time to grieve.
Having years of work come to an abrupt end will take a toll on your mental health;
many of your colleagues will be suffering as well,
and those who haven't been hit (yet) may be affected by survivors' guilt.
Be angry,
be sad,
but remember that in the aftermath of a disaster---natural or man-made---people
often become altruistic, resourceful, and brave \cite{Yang2024}.</p>
<h2>Organize</h2>
<p>There is little point surviving today's flood if you drown in tomorrow's.
The best strategy is to take preventive action,
and the best way to do that in a research context
is to become active in professional associations
and push them to take meaningful action.</p>
<p>Many readers of this paper will find the thought of doing this uncomfortable,
in large part because 
voluntary organizations have seen a slow but steady decline in membership over several decades \cite{Putnam2020}.
Although there are many contributing factors,
the net result is that professionals aged 30--60
are less likely to be involved in civil society and the political process than the generation before them.
This disengagement effectively hands power to extremists and special interest groups
and enables them to seize control of civil institutions in order to advance their agendas \cite{BuenoDeMesquita2022}.
To see the impact,
ask yourself who is more likely to run for a seat on your local school board:
someone with a doctorate in epidemiology or an anti-vax conspiracy theorist?</p>
<p>We have written this paper because we believe that scientific inquiry is a public good and worth fighting for.
The present climate requires us to focus on preserving what we can,
but playing defense is just a way to lose more slowly.
If we work together and accept that we and our institutions need to change,
we can create a world in which research does not just survive,
but thrives.</p>
