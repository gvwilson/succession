# Project Transition To-Do Items

## 1. Digital Asset Inventory Checklist

Creating a comprehensive inventory of all digital assets is essential for smooth project transitions. This should include domain names, social media accounts, cloud storage services, databases, email accounts, and any automated systems or bots. Each asset should be documented with login credentials, renewal dates, associated costs, and the level of access required for maintenance. Consider using a password manager or secure document to track this information, ensuring that successors can access everything they need. Don't forget about less obvious digital assets like analytics accounts, monitoring services, or third-party integrations that may be running in the background.

## 2. Financial Account Management

Project transitions require careful handling of financial obligations including bank accounts, credit cards, subscription services, and recurring payments. Document all financial commitments with details about payment schedules, cancellation policies, and any contractual obligations that extend beyond your departure. Create a clear plan for transferring account ownership or ensuring continued payment for essential services during the transition period. Consider setting up temporary shared access or authorization for successors to manage urgent financial matters. Establish a timeline for reviewing and either transferring or canceling each financial commitment based on the project's future needs.

## 3. Stakeholder Communication Templates

Different stakeholder groups require tailored communication approaches when announcing leadership transitions or project changes. Funders need to understand how the transition affects grant obligations and deliverables, while collaborators require information about ongoing partnerships and shared commitments. Users and community members benefit from clear information about service continuity and future support, while volunteers need guidance on how their roles may change. Develop template messages for each group that can be customized based on specific circumstances, ensuring consistent messaging while addressing each group's particular concerns. Include contact information for follow-up questions and establish a timeline for when different groups will be notified.

## 4. Exit Interview Framework

Systematic exit interviews with departing team members capture valuable institutional knowledge that might otherwise be lost. Develop a structured interview process that covers both explicit knowledge (documented processes, technical details) and tacit knowledge (informal relationships, unwritten practices, historical context). Focus on identifying critical knowledge gaps and potential risks that may not be immediately obvious to remaining team members. Document these conversations and create action plans for preserving or transferring the most important insights. Consider conducting follow-up interviews several weeks after departure when additional knowledge gaps may become apparent.

## 5. Maintaining Team Morale During Transitions

Uncertainty during leadership transitions can significantly impact team productivity and morale, requiring proactive management strategies. Establish clear communication channels and regular check-ins to address concerns and provide updates on transition progress. Be transparent about what is known and unknown about the project's future while emphasizing opportunities for growth and new directions. Recognize that different team members may react differently to change, with some embracing new possibilities while others feel anxious about stability. Create opportunities for team input on transition decisions and maintain focus on immediate project goals to provide stability during uncertain times.

## 6. Research Data Archiving Procedures

Proper data archiving according to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) ensures research value persists beyond project transitions. Identify all datasets, analysis scripts, and associated documentation that need to be preserved, ensuring they meet institutional and funding agency requirements for data management. Choose appropriate repositories based on data type, access requirements, and long-term preservation capabilities, considering both institutional repositories and discipline-specific archives. Create comprehensive metadata and documentation that enables future researchers to understand and utilize the data effectively. Establish clear data access policies and procedures for how others can request and use the archived materials.

## 7. Software License and Service Agreement Management

Managing software licenses and service agreements requires careful attention to transfer procedures and contractual obligations. Document all commercial software licenses, including seat counts, renewal dates, and transfer policies, as some licenses may not be transferable or may require vendor approval for ownership changes. Review service level agreements for cloud platforms, hosting services, and other technical infrastructure to understand termination procedures and data export options. Consider the timing of license transfers or cancellations to avoid service disruptions during critical transition periods. Maintain relationships with key vendors who can assist with smooth transitions and provide technical support during handover activities.

## 8. Transition Timeline Template

A well-structured timeline helps ensure all critical tasks are completed with appropriate lead time for complex transitions. The six-month milestone should focus on strategic planning including succession identification, stakeholder notification, and major documentation projects. Three months out, emphasis shifts to knowledge transfer activities, training successors, and beginning formal handover processes for key responsibilities. At one month, attention turns to finalizing documentation, transferring accounts and access permissions, and conducting final reviews of all transition activities. The final week requires intense focus on last-minute details, emergency contacts, and ensuring all critical systems and processes continue functioning smoothly.

## 9. Vendor Relationship Management

Maintaining positive vendor relationships during leadership changes requires proactive communication and clear transition protocols. Notify key vendors about upcoming leadership changes well in advance, introducing them to successors and ensuring continuity of service relationships. Review all contracts for clauses related to personnel changes, as some agreements may require notification or approval for changes in project leadership. Document the history and context of vendor relationships, including any ongoing issues, negotiated terms, or special arrangements that may not be reflected in formal contracts. Establish clear contact protocols so vendors know whom to reach during the transition period and beyond.

## 10. Preserving Project Culture and Values

Project culture encompasses the unwritten rules, shared values, and working practices that make projects successful and sustainable. Document the core values and principles that guide decision-making, including examples of how these values are applied in practice and why they matter to the project's success. Identify cultural practices, traditions, and communication norms that contribute to positive team dynamics and project effectiveness. Discuss with successors how to maintain positive cultural elements while allowing for natural evolution and improvement. Consider creating informal mentorship opportunities or advisory roles that help preserve institutional memory while empowering new leadership to develop their own approach.

## 11. Managing Ongoing Collaborations and Partnerships

Research collaborations often span multiple years and involve complex interpersonal and institutional relationships that require careful management during transitions. Review all active collaborations to assess their status, remaining obligations, and the level of personal relationship involved in maintaining the partnership. Communicate with collaborators about leadership changes early enough to allow for relationship building with successors while ensuring continuity of shared work. Document the history and context of each collaboration, including informal agreements, communication preferences, and any ongoing tensions or issues that may not be immediately apparent. Consider facilitating introduction meetings between collaborators and successors to establish personal connections that support continued partnership.

## 12. Media and Public Relations Management

Leadership transitions, especially those involving controversy or sudden departures, require careful management of public communications and media relations. Develop key messages that accurately represent the situation while protecting the privacy and reputation of all involved parties, ensuring consistency across all communication channels. Identify who will serve as the primary spokesperson during the transition period and ensure they are prepared to handle both routine and challenging questions from media or stakeholders. Consider proactive communication strategies that allow the organization to control the narrative rather than simply responding to external inquiries or speculation. Prepare for potential negative coverage by developing response strategies and identifying supportive voices who can provide context or positive perspectives.

## 13. Project Continuation Assessment Framework

Not all projects should continue indefinitely, and leadership transitions provide natural opportunities to assess whether continuation, merger, or discontinuation makes the most sense. Evaluate project impact, resource requirements, and strategic fit with current priorities and available capabilities under new leadership. Assess whether the project's goals can be better achieved through merger with similar initiatives or whether the project has fulfilled its intended purpose and should be concluded gracefully. Consider the perspectives of key stakeholders, including funders, users, and team members, in making these decisions while recognizing that emotional attachment may influence judgment. Document the decision-making process and rationale to help stakeholders understand and accept the chosen direction.

## 14. Grant Reporting and Compliance Obligations

Grant-funded projects have specific reporting requirements and compliance obligations that must be maintained during leadership transitions to avoid funding penalties or legal issues. Review all active grants to identify upcoming reporting deadlines, required deliverables, and any personnel change notification requirements that funders may have established. Ensure that new project leaders understand the full scope of grant obligations and have access to all necessary documentation and financial records required for compliance. Consider whether leadership changes affect the project's ability to meet original grant commitments and communicate any necessary modifications to funders as early as possible. Maintain detailed records of all grant-related communications and decisions during the transition period to support future reporting and audit requirements.

## 15. Sensitive Data and Confidentiality Management

Research projects often involve sensitive data subject to privacy regulations, institutional policies, or confidentiality agreements that require special handling during transitions. Review all data handling agreements, ethics approvals, and confidentiality commitments to understand restrictions on data access, transfer, or sharing that may affect transition planning. Ensure that successors receive appropriate training and authorization to handle sensitive data according to established protocols and legal requirements. Document all data security measures, access controls, and audit trails that must be maintained throughout the transition process. Consider whether any data should be anonymized, archived, or destroyed as part of the transition to reduce ongoing compliance burdens for successors.

## 16. Technical Knowledge Transfer Strategies

When technical expertise is concentrated in one or two individuals, special strategies are needed to ensure knowledge transfer and project continuity. Identify the most critical technical knowledge and skills that are not documented and prioritize these for intensive knowledge transfer activities such as pair programming, shadowing, or intensive documentation sessions. Create multiple formats for knowledge sharing including written documentation, video recordings, and hands-on training sessions to accommodate different learning styles and reference needs. Establish ongoing mentorship or consulting arrangements with departing technical experts to provide support during the initial transition period when questions and issues are most likely to arise. Consider whether external consultants or contractors might be needed to fill technical gaps while new team members develop expertise.

## 17. Volunteer Coordination and Engagement

Volunteer-based projects require special attention to maintaining engagement and coordination during leadership transitions, as volunteers may be particularly sensitive to uncertainty and change. Communicate transparently with volunteers about transition plans while emphasizing the continued value of their contributions and the organization's commitment to its mission. Identify volunteer leaders who can help maintain continuity and serve as liaisons during the transition period, providing stability and familiar faces for other volunteers. Review volunteer management systems, communication channels, and recognition programs to ensure new leadership can continue effective volunteer engagement. Consider conducting volunteer feedback sessions to understand concerns and suggestions for maintaining engagement during the transition.

## 18. Professional Network and Relationship Preservation

Institutional relationships and professional networks are often built around personal connections that may not automatically transfer to successors. Identify key relationships that are critical to the project's success and develop strategies for introducing successors to important contacts while you still have influence and credibility. Document the history and context of important professional relationships, including mutual commitments, informal agreements, and personal preferences that may affect future interactions. Consider facilitating joint meetings, conference introductions, or collaborative activities that allow successors to build their own relationships with key contacts. Maintain some level of connection with critical relationships during the initial transition period to provide support and credibility for successors while they establish their own professional standing.

## 19. Academic Obligations and Student Supervision

Academic projects often involve ongoing obligations to students, institutions, and degree programs that require special consideration during transitions. Review all student supervision commitments, including thesis committees, research mentorship, and course responsibilities, to ensure continuity of support and appropriate transition of supervisory relationships. Communicate with institutional administrators about transition plans well in advance to ensure compliance with academic policies and to arrange for coverage of essential teaching and service obligations. Document student progress, research projects, and any special circumstances or accommodations that successors need to understand for effective supervision. Consider whether co-supervision arrangements or gradual transition of supervisory responsibilities might be beneficial for maintaining student relationships and research continuity.

## 20. Emergency Communication Protocols

Crisis situations that threaten project continuity require pre-established communication protocols and emergency contacts to enable rapid response and coordination. Develop emergency contact lists that include key stakeholders, service providers, institutional contacts, and team members, ensuring that multiple people have access to this information. Establish clear communication hierarchies and decision-making authorities for different types of emergencies, from technical failures to personnel crises to external threats. Create template communications for common emergency scenarios that can be quickly customized and deployed through multiple channels including email, social media, and direct phone contact. Test emergency communication procedures periodically and update contact information regularly to ensure effectiveness when crisis situations actually occur.
